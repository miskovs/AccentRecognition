<h1>To setup:</h1>

1. I suggest using virtualenv. To create a new one write this in repo root directory:

```
python -m venv venv
```

<p>This creates a venv folder in which you will store all packages locally. To activate the virtual environment, go to venv/bin and launch the <b>activate</b> script.</p>

2. Install all required packages using pip

```
python -m pip install -r reqs.txt
```


3. You are good to go!
